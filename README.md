## Projects

### 1. **Unveiling Trends in Leading AI and Machine Learning Companies' Stock Prices: A Time Series Analysis**
This project explores how time series analysis can be used to predict trends in the stock prices of leading AI and Machine Learning companies: **Alphabet (Google)**, **Meta (Facebook)**, and **Microsoft**. The goal is to assess the performance of various time series models such as **ARIMA**, **ARIMA-GARCH**, **RNN**, **LSTM**, and **GRU** in forecasting stock prices.

- **Main Techniques Used**: Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, ARIMA-GARCH, RNN, LSTM, GRU
- **Key Findings**: GRU models outperformed traditional statistical models like ARIMA-GARCH in terms of predictive accuracy.
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance (Historical stock price data)

### 2. **Bank Marketing Machine Learning Project**
This project aims to optimize a bank's marketing campaigns by predicting customer responses to marketing offers. The solution employs machine learning to segment customers and identify those most likely to respond to the campaigns, improving the overall targeting strategy.

- **Main Techniques Used**: Random Forest for classification, data preprocessing using Alteryx, and customer segmentation
- **Key Findings**: A Random Forest model was the best performer with an AUC score of 0.76, highlighting economic indicators and past interactions as strong predictors of customer response.
- **Data Source**: A customer dataset provided for marketing campaign analysis

### 3. **Global Life Expectancy Statistical Analysis**
In this project, I conducted a statistical analysis of factors influencing life expectancy globally, focusing on data from the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. Key factors like **BMI**, **healthcare expenditure**, **HIV prevalence**, and **education levels** were analyzed to understand their impact on life expectancy across developed and developing countries.

- **Main Techniques Used**: ANOVA, Regression Analysis, Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Holtâ€™s model)
- **Key Findings**: Life expectancy is positively correlated with education and income composition. The ARIMA model predicted a steady rise in life expectancy globally.
- **Data Source**: WHO Life Expectancy dataset

Dive into this project for an in-depth look at the analysis, forecasts, and the factors influencing global life expectancy trends.
